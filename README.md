Build_Compose_and_Decorate_A_Complete_Traditional_OOP_Practice_Series

1. Using self
Assignment:
Create a class Student with attributes name and marks. Use the self keyword to initialize these values via a constructor. Add a method display() that prints student details.

2. Using cls
Assignment:
Create a class Counter that keeps track of how many objects have been created. Use a class variable and a class method with cls to manage and display the count.

3. Public Variables and Methods
Assignment:
Create a class Car with a public variable brand and a public method start(). Instantiate the class and access both from outside the class.

4. Class Variables and Class Methods
Assignment:
Create a class Bank with a class variable bank_name. Add a class method change_bank_name(cls, name) that allows changing the bank name. Show that it affects all instances.

5. Static Variables and Static Methods
Assignment:
Create a class MathUtils with a static method add(a, b) that returns the sum. No class or instance variables should be used.

6. Constructors and Destructors
Assignment:
Create a class Logger that prints a message when an object is created (constructor) and another message when it is destroyed (destructor).

7. Access Modifiers: Public, Private, and Protected
Assignment:
Create a class Employee with:

a public variable name,

a protected variable _salary, and

a private variable __ssn.

Try accessing all three variables from an object of the class and document what happens.

8. The super() Function
Assignment:
Create a class Person with a constructor that sets the name. Inherit a class Teacher from it, add a subject field, and use super() to call the base class constructor.

9. Abstract Classes and Methods
Assignment:
Use the abc module to create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area(). Inherit a class Rectangle that implements area().

10. Instance Methods
Assignment:
Create a class Dog with instance variables name and breed. Add an instance method bark() that prints a message including the dog's name.

11. Class Methods
Assignment:
Create a class Book with a class variable total_books. Add a class method increment_book_count() to increase the count when a new book is added.

12. Static Methods
Assignment:
Create a class TemperatureConverter with a static method celsius_to_fahrenheit(c) that returns the Fahrenheit value.

13. Composition
Assignment:
Create a class Engine and a class Car. Use composition by passing an Engine object to the Car class during initialization. Access a method of the Engine class via the Car class.

14. Aggregation
Assignment:
Create a class Department and a class Employee. Use aggregation by having a Department object store a reference to an Employee object that exists independently of it.

15. Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance
Assignment:
Create four classes:

A with a method show(),

B and C that inherit from A and override show(),

D that inherits from both B and C.

Create an object of D and call show() to observe MRO.

16. Function Decorators
Assignment:
Write a decorator function log_function_call that prints "Function is being called" before a function executes. Apply it to a function say_hello().

17. Class Decorators
Assignment:
Create a class decorator add_greeting that modifies a class to add a greet() method returning "Hello from Decorator!". Apply it to a class Person.

18. Property Decorators: @property, @setter, and @deleter
Assignment:
Create a class Product with a private attribute _price. Use @property to get the price, @price.setter to update it, and @price.deleter to delete it.

19. callable() and __call__()
Assignment:
Create a class Multiplier with an __init__() to set a factor. Define a __call__() method that multiplies an input by the factor. Test it with callable() and by calling the object like a function.

20. Creating a Custom Exception
Assignment:
Create a custom exception InvalidAgeError. Write a function check_age(age) that raises this exception if age < 18. Handle it with try...except.

21. Make a Custom Class Iterable
Assignment:
Create a class Countdown that takes a start number. Implement __iter__() and __next__() to make the object iterable in a for-loop, counting down to 0.
